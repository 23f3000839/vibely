i think this rooms video audio chat join issue is not solving and it is most prob because media soup library
we should now use some better tech which is best known by you and best for our project, can build everything i want
rewrite all mediasoup.ts, socket-server.ts, socket.ts, index.ts, types/socket.ts, hooks files, rooms.tsx, routes,

DO NOT CHANGE THE UI

all i want is participants are able to join room and see each other camera, listen to audio talk in real time, chat in real time and all this done prefectly to all the users and updates for all.

user can mute, deafer, close/turn of on camera
admin can to mute, turn on/off camera of other participants also bu clicking on the three dots of there respective window, the camera window things are dynamic and size shape positions changes as more people join

no of participants changes in real time in room card of browse rooms, three dot button from where admin of rooms can edit all the fields and delete the room
as room deletes all the active participants in the room get cut immediately 
only max participants join if room is full it shows notification max no of users already in room

delete the unnesessary files and make new required ones if needed
